# Hubdex: Job Application Tracker

</p>

**Hubdex** is a focused, open-source job application tracker: one hub for every role, stage, and decision in your job search. Log every application, move it through a five-stage pipeline (Wishlist, Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected), and see exactly where your search stands, without a spreadsheet in sight.

Built as a real-world example of a full-stack, real-time React app with a Convex backend.

## Features

- **Five-stage pipeline:** Wishlist, Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected, with live per-stage counts that update everywhere instantly.
- **Real-time stats:** Total, active, interview, and offer counts are computed on the server and stay in sync automatically via Convex's reactive queries.
- **Search & filter:** Instantly filter by keyword or stage; the pipeline tiles double as quick filters.
- **Inline stage editing:** Click a stage tag in the table to promote a role the moment the recruiter calls.
- **Full application records:** Company, role, location, salary, posting URL, priority, applied date, and private notes.
- **Auth built-in:** Email OTP, email + password, or anonymous guest sessions, powered by Convex Auth. Every application is scoped to the signed-in user, and all reads/writes are enforced server-side.
- **Carbon-inspired design:** Sharp geometry, hairline grids, tabular numerals, mobile responsive, with dark mode support.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+ (Node 20 recommended)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh), or npm/pnpm if you prefer (just swap the `bun` commands)
- A free [Convex](https://www.convex.dev) account (backend + database hosting)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akinmoldun/hubdex-tracker.git
cd hubdex-tracker
bun install
```

### 2. Start the Convex backend

```bash
bunx convex dev
```

The first run will:

- Open your browser to log in to Convex
- Ask you to create a new Convex project (or pick an existing one)
- Write `VITE_CONVEX_URL` into a local `.env.local` for you

Keep this command running; it pushes your backend functions to Convex and regenerates `src/convex/_generated/` as you develop.

### 3. Start the frontend (second terminal)

```bash
bun run dev
```

Then open the local URL it prints (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### 4. Create your account

Go to `/auth` in the running app and sign in with:

- **Email OTP:** a one-time code sent to your email, or
- **Email + password**, or
- **Continue as guest:** an anonymous session for a quick try

That's it. Add your first application and start moving it through the pipeline.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Where | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `VITE_CONVEX_URL` | `.env.local` (frontend) | URL of your Convex deployment, created automatically by `convex dev` |
| `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` | `.env.local` (frontend) | Name of your Convex deployment, also created by `convex dev` |

Convex Auth secrets (JWT keys, site URL) are managed on the Convex side and are set up automatically for local development. You should never need to create these by hand.

> Never commit your `.env.local`; it's already excluded by `.gitignore`.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `bun run dev` | Start the Vite dev server |
| `bun run build` | Type-check and build for production (`dist/`) |
| `bun run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `bun run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `bun run format` | Format the codebase with Prettier |
| `bunx convex dev` | Push Convex functions + regenerate types (dev) |
